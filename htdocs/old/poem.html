			<p class="poem">	she looked at her neon green fuzzy slippers, one turned upside down and the other facing backwards. </br></br>
				her one teacher she was so scared of she refrained from asking any questions about a project and got an F for not following the directions clearly.</br></br>
				her three-month old toothbrush.</br></br>
				her unfinished english paper, which had a fake date on the top right hand corner because she didn&#39;t want her teacher to think she procrastinated until the day before.</br></br>
				her friend that never gave that one perfectly-sharpened, full-eraser ticonderoga #2 pencil back in sixth grade.</br></br>
				her clock, which was exactly two minutes and forty three seconds early. It annoyed her to no end, but she never had the intention to fix it.</br></br>
				her tangled earbuds.</br></br>
				her mechanical pencil with its completely used eraser so now she had to fit the lead through the front instead of taking out the eraser in the back.</br></br>
				her unmade bed. Currently the covers were half-dangling off the right side of the bed and her pillow was nowhere to be seen.</br></br>
				she looked at her neon green fuzzy slippers again. </br></br>
				then she looked at me, and her brown eyes widening in realization.</br></br>
				&quot;So this is life.&quot;
